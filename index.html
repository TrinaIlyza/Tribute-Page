            <div>
                <p>John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) was an English philosopher who is probably best known as a liberal. His classic “philosophic textbook of a single truth” (as he called it), On Liberty, was published in 1859 and is, by general agreement, the best clear, short statement of the key idea of liberalism: that individuals should have extensive freedom up to the point where they risk harming others.                </p>
                <ul>
                <li> Born on 20 May 1806 in Pentonville, then a northern suburb of London, to Harriet Barrow and James Mill.</li>
                <li> A liberal classical economist, Mill was an advocate of individual rights, progressive social policies, and utilitarianism (which promotes actions that do "the greatest good for the greatest number")."</li>
                <li> Mill believed that economic theory and philosophy, along with social awareness, should play a role in politics nad shape public policy. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="centered">In order of publication, Mill's best-known works include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>1843</strong> - A System of Logic, which outlines the methods of science and how they can be applied to social mechanics.</li>
                <li><strong>1848</strong> - Principles of Political Economy, which combines the disciplines of philosophy and economics and advocates that population limits and slowed economic growth would be beneficial to the environment and increase public goods.</li>
                <li><strong>1859</strong> - On Liberty, which addresses the nature and limits of the power that can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual, introducing the harm principle and defending free speech.</li>
                <li><strong>1863</strong> - Utilitarianism, which expounds on Bentham's original philosophy, using it as the foundation of morals—rejecting the idea that it promotes narrow self-interest, and arguing it aims for the betterment of society as a whole.</li>
                <li><strong>1869</strong> - The Subjection of Women, which makes the case for women's suffrage and gender equality.</li>
                <li><strong>1874</strong> - Three Essays on Religion, which critiques traditional, religious orthodoxy and advocates a more liberal "religion of humanity" (published posthumously).</li>
                <li><strong>1874</strong> - Autobiography, which was written the year he died and published posthumously.</li>
                <li><strong>1873</strong> - Died on 8 May 1873</li>
            </ul>

            <q class="ending">“The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest-Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.”</q>
